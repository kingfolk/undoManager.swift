# undoManager.swift
simple undo manager using closure/lambda implementing in Apple Swift. Simple source code and an example to checkout.

Idea is from [Javascript-Undo-Manager](https://github.com/ArthurClemens/Javascript-Undo-Manager). As a "long-time" JS programmer. Love the simpleness of the implementation most of time. So I introduce the closure based undo manager to Swift. Closure is powerful as superman. Enjoy
